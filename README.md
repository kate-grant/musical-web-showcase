# The Musical Web Showcase

This website was built to showcase creative works made for the SFPC The Musical Web course, a 3-month exploration of Web Audio. I participated in this course as a student.

## Goals

The primary goal of this project is to highlight the creative work of all participating artists, technologists, musicians, and software engineers, celebrating the creative exploration, ideas, and works made by students in this course.

This course used Glitch as the main collaborative and educational coding environment, and in the spirit of this, this website was made on Glitch.
