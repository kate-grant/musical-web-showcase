    projectDescription: "Through my work &quot;YouAreAmI&quot;, I explore the concept of shared space and the emotions that arise from being in it. As someone who craves both togetherness and independence, I am fascinated by the connections that are formed--wanted or not--in shared spaces. To explore this, &quot;YouAreAmI&quot; uses a premade additive oscillator synth module that I've modified using proximity between users as a way to manipulate pitch and harmonic decay. The idea is that the proximity between users creates a feeling of increased activity, anxiety, distraction, or intimacy, much like sharing physical space. I offer participants text inputs that prompt and collect communication, which is further processed for sentiment value by a machine learning model trained on poetry. Sentiment is communicated actively and passively by participants, and can be experienced through the shared impact of participant behavior as expressed in the visual field and in additional synthesizer parameters. I use graphics of airbrushed squiggly lines as a backdrop to create a soft, vulnerable feeling that is reminiscent of the complexity of emotions that arise in shared spaces.", 
    artistBio: "Kate Grant is a musician, technologist, and internet radio dj with work that focuses on recording the aural landscapes of Brooklyn‚Äôs urban ecosystems as a frame for composed and generative music. Under the name Inachis, she performs guitar and hardware-based compositions. In June 2021 she released an album of brief sketches based on the generational changes in urbanization and return of healthy ecosystems to the Southern Brooklyn wetlands, a project that incorporated field recordings made in public parks. After years as a technology autodidact and programming polyglot, she recently pursued training in software engineering, with an interest in audio technology and signal processing. She studied music at CUNY Hunter College."

    projectDescription: "After sitting with field recordings from the past three years, I decided to try and create an interactive gallery of sorts; where pressing a button or two buttons at once create an audio/visual experience for the viewer. In the next iteration, I hope to make it more of a tool to explore the field recordings, rather than just audio playback.",

They ground themself in the endless possibilities of the future. As they move forward in the life, they are rediscovering the world one daydream at a time.

    videoHeight:"315", 
    videoWidth:"420", 
    projectDescription: "The triangulator synth is an instrument that allows players to manipulate the parameters of three FM synthesizers by interacting with three triangles. When players manipulate the triangles, they connect their visual and mathematical intuition to the intangible qualities of synthesized sound. By constraining the synthesis parameters to attributes of triangles, the triangulator re-introduces the physical or geometric constraints of an acoustic instrument's sound to the unconstrained realm of software synthesis.",

Every keystroke can only type vegetables, and the entire piece is networked such that viewers can see every vegetable left behind by previous and concurrent viewers, creating a community garden out of emojis and minimal web elements.<br><br>Windward Drifters is a minimalist simulation investigating the feeling of the wind and synthesis of birdsong. Viewers can use their mouse to steer a cloud of origami cranes through the air, while the cranes communicate with each other using synthesized bird phrases from bird songs that don't exist outside of the webpage. As a dyptic, the two create balance; Useful Fields investigates the notion of the earth in the browser, while Wayward Drifters investigates the feelings and sounds of the the heavens. ", 
    artistBio:"Arden is a programmer, artist, and teacher based in the San Fransisco Bay Area. Their work investigates emergent natural phenomena using interactive simulations and creative coding. They are fascinated with, multiplicity, warmth, and the notion of organic computing, and have taken three SFPC classes: Scrapism, Algorithmic Botany, and Musical Web."

This is the most challenging project I have worked on so far and I worry that she will see it and email me about it. She‚Äôs pretty good about finding me and just knowing when I am thinking about her. I deem that to be equally scary and as it is impressive.<br><br>So, if you are somehow reading this mom, know that I hope we can eventually have a healthy relationship. I wish things were different and maybe one day they will be. I think about you every time I look in the mirror, or have a cigarette, or wear the boots I bought that look just like yours, or see the color blue.",

    projectDescription: "Throughout this course, I've been working with field recordings and audio ripped from candid videos.  In this work, I wanted to explore the feeling of wading through this collection of memories. Memories have a slippery nature; each visit is unique and the art of remembering is imprecise. In this work, I wanted to create a piece with a strong narrative element, but a non-deterministic experience. As keys on the &quothome row&quot of the keyboard are pressed, chords and random notes accompany snippets from an old poem. The keypresses trigger shifts in the scene and progression of the piece. Each time will be different.",
