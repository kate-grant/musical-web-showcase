As someone who craves both togetherness and independence, I am fascinated by the connections that are formed--wanted or not--in shared spaces. To explore this, &quot;YouAreAmI&quot; uses a premade additive oscillator synth module that I've modified using proximity between users as a way to manipulate pitch and harmonic decay. The idea is that the proximity between users creates a feeling of increased activity, anxiety, distraction, or intimacy, much like sharing physical space. I offer participants text inputs that prompt and collect communication, which is further processed for sentiment value by a machine learning model trained on poetry. Sentiment is communicated actively and passively by participants, and can be experienced through the shared impact of participant behavior as expressed in the visual field and in additional synthesizer parameters. I use graphics of airbrushed squiggly lines as a backdrop to create a soft, vulnerable feeling that is reminiscent of the complexity of emotions that arise in shared spaces.", artistBio: "Kate Grant is a musician, technologist, and internet radio dj with work that focuses on recording the aural landscapes of Brooklynâ€™s urban ecosystems as a frame for composed and generative music. Under the name Inachis, she performs guitar and hardware-based compositions. In June 2021 she released an album of brief sketches based on the generational changes in urbanization and return of healthy ecosystems to the Southern Brooklyn wetlands, a project that incorporated field recordings made in public parks. After years as a technology autodidact and programming polyglot, she recently pursued training in software engineering, with an interest in audio technology and signal processing. She studied music at CUNY Hunter College."}, a: {projectName: "Re-arranging", artistName:"Ali Akhtar", projectLink: "https://rearranging.glitch.me/", videoLink: "", videoHeight:"315", videoWidth:"420", projectDescription: "My work fills the long standing desire in my life to be able to throw a guitar across a room - I wanted to make a 3D space where you can interact with all sorts of different sounds and see how they interact with one another.", artistBio:"Ali is a musician and software engineer based out of Brooklyn, NY."}, b: {projectName: "Re-arranging", artistName:"Ali Akhtar", projectLink: "https://rearranging.glitch.me/", videoLink: "", videoHeight:"315", videoWidth:"420", projectDescription: "My work fills the long standing desire in my life to be able to throw a guitar across a room - I wanted to make a 3D space where you can interact with all sorts of different sounds and see how they interact with one another.", artistBio:"Ali is a musician and software engineer based out of Brooklyn, NY."}}
